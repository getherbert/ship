# Ship

If you have any issues or feedback on [Ship](http://ship.getherbert.com/) please post them as Github issues.

As part of Ship we store your login details for WordPress.org, these are required to work with their SVN system. Passwords are encrypted using OpenSSL and the `AES-256-CBC` cypher. 

Ideally we would prefer to use SSH keys or OAuth system but couldnâ€™t find any way of achieving this with WordPress.org. If you have a better suggestion on how to handle this we would love to hear.

This repo will remain empty.
